# go-api

My current project to create a GraphQL API using Golang and PostgreSQL.

## .env
To be created before deploy, ensure the .env file is included in the root with the collowing variables set, as this is required for the env file for docker-compose as well as for the api itself. This hosts sensitive data only:
* PASSWORD
* USERNAME
